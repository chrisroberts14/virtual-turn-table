Music streaming services have transformed the way people access and experience music, yet there has been a resurgence in the use of vinyl as a format for music consumption. This report details the creation of a web application that combines aspects of the traditional turntable with the convenience of digital music streaming. The key feature is the ability to use physical albums to play music, with the application identifying the album based on its artwork. Modern software development practices are implemented, including automated testing, deployment, and dependency management. An evaluation of the application involving testing the accuracy of the album identification method and surveying users who used it showed it was mostly well received. However, it did fall short in terms of usability and accuracy of scanning albums. Future work would focus on issues in album identification and the addition of new features such as audio fingerprinting and mobile device support.
