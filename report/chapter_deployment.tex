\section{Docker compose}
Docker compose allows the program to run all the associated microservices, each running in their own Docker container, on the same local machine. The main benefit of this is we can run the whole system on any machine which can run Docker. If the application were to be run like this with all services on the same machine this would be a good way to do it but for the most part this was used to make sure the containers were each working as expected during end to end testing of the system.
