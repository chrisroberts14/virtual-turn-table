Due to their contrast in priorities and architecture to conventional relational databases using SQL, these databases are referred as “NoSQL” databases since they ​incorporate lots of additional features in addition to the features of conventional databases. The relational databases strongly follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties while the NoSQL databases follow BASE (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual consistency) principles. This survey paper is an analytical study on BASE features of some of NoSQL databases.}

The present chapter provides an introduction to the rationale and techniques used for the rapid prototyping of the user interface (UI). It is intended primarily for those practitioners who are now known as “user interface designers” or “dialogue designers.” The reader will become familiar with the benefits to rapid prototyping, the role of prototyping in alternative development strategies, and the classes of prototyping techniques. First we review the major issues surrounding the integration of prototyping tools into the user interface design process. Both the nature of the products that can be simulated and the nature of the users applying the tools are explored. The remaining sections analyze the components of a prototyping tool. A complete prototyping system requires methods for specifying interface graphics as well as product logic. Support tools and embedded data collection test facilities can also be integrated to facilitate the testing process.}

These functional relationships can then be used to synthesize algorithmically a relational scheme. It is the purpose of this paper to present an effective procedure for performing such a synthesis. The schema that results from this procedure is proved to be in Codd's third normal form and to contain the fewest possible number of relations. Problems with earlier attempts to construct such a procedure are also discussed.},
