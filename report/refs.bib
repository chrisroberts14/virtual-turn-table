abstract = {The paper is focused on so called NoSQL databases. In context of cloud computing, architectures and basic features of these databases are studied, particularly their horizontal scalability and concurrency model, that is mostly weaker than ACID transactions in relational SQL-like database systems. Some characteristics like a data model and querying capabilities are discussed in more detail. The paper also contains an overview of some representatives of NoSQL databases.},
